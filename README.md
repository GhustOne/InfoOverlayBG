# InfoOverlayBG
A script for 2Take1's Lua Engine
> thanks to kektram and all the others who taught me more about lua

## How to install
Download InfoOverlayBG.lua from [**releases**](https://github.com/GhustOne/InfoOverlayBG/releases)

Drag and drop "InfoOverlayBG.lua" in AppData\Roaming\PopstarDevs\2Take1Menu\scripts or "appdata_popstar" shortcut in 2t1 folder > 2Take1Menu > scripts

If you are updating from an older version then you can replace the old one.

## Purpose

**The info inside is from 2take1's own info overlay, it doesnt come with the lua.**
